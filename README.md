# Cough-Analysis

The project, “Detection of Pneumonia and Acute Bronchitis in Children Using Deep Learning,” focuses on developing a non-invasive diagnostic tool using cough sound analysis. Leveraging advanced preprocessing techniques like noise reduction and segmentation, audio samples were converted into embeddings using YAMNet. These embeddings were classified with a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network, achieving 98% accuracy. The system addressed challenges like variability in cough patterns and background noise, ensuring robustness across diverse environments. Optimized for scalability, it supports deployment on portable devices, enabling real-time diagnostics in resource-constrained areas. This tool aims to revolutionize pediatric respiratory care by providing accurate, early detection.
